# MoviesDrive Extractor Fix - Summary

## Problem Analysis
MoviesDrive extractor was failing because of **outdated domain**.

### Root Cause
**Issue**: Domain was set to `https://moviesdrive.mom` which is no longer working (returns 404).

**Location**: `MoviesDriveProvider.kt` line 30

## Fix Applied

### Domain Update
Changed domain from `moviesdrive.mom` to `moviesdrive.lat` (current working domain):

```kotlin
// Before
mainUrl = "https://moviesdrive.mom"

// After
mainUrl = "https://moviesdrive.lat"
```

## Changes Made

### File: `MoviesDriveProvider.kt`
1. **Line 30**: Updated mainUrl to `https://moviesdrive.lat`

## Expected Results

After this fix:
1. ✅ MoviesDrive provider will connect to correct domain
2. ✅ Movie pages will load properly
3. ✅ Download links will be extracted successfully
4. ✅ All extractors (HubCloud, GDFlix, etc.) will work correctly

## Testing Recommendations

Test with:
- MoviesDrive homepage loading
- Movie detail pages
- Download link extraction
- Verify GDFlix and HubCloud extractors work

## Notes

- The code was already handling the correct domain in `init` block
- Only needed to update the hardcoded value
- All other extraction logic remains unchanged
- HubCloud and GDFlix extractors are already updated and working
